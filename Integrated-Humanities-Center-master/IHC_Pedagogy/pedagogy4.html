    <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Key is Communication!</h2>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> <strong>Explain the logic of how you communicate.</strong> <br>
      It may be helpful to establish expectations around communication in the course in the first week and on the syllabus.&nbsp; <strong>Explain to your students both HOW you will communicate with them</strong> (emails, the announcements page in Canvas, etc.) and WHAT they can expect to find in these planned emails/announcements.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      You may also wish to set your students’ expectations around how long you will take to answer emails and/or when you go offline for the evening (e.g., I rarely check emails after 6pm).&nbsp; Consider giving students another way to reach out to you—a phone number or a mobile number where they can text you.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Establish a predictable pattern of communication—and stick to it.<br>
      </strong>Faculty and instructors are encouraged <strong>to establish a clear, predictable pattern of communicating with students</strong>.&nbsp; Let students know HOW you are using Canvas—what they will (and will not be able to find) on it. Consider a short screen capture video in the first week with an overview of how you will use Canvas and your method of organizing materials on the site.</p>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Especially if you are not seeing your students F2F, consider reaching out to students via email at least twice a week.&nbsp; An email at the beginning of the week might include a summary of the week ahead, including links to any due dates or special activities (e.g., a discussion board or peer review).&nbsp; An email at the end of the week, might be a bit more personal—celebrating something from class that happened during the week, wishing everyone a nice weekend, noting a relevant event or anniversary related to the work of the class, and/or previewing the next week.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Communicate the same thing in multiple places.</strong><br>
      Consider making communications available in multiple spaces—of course, you send them via email, but consider posting a version of it in the “Announcements” area of the course on Canvas as well.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Add rich, dynamic content.<br>
      </strong>Consider adding images or video content to your emails. You might send them a video of you talking through the week for 2 minutes at the beginning of the week.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Personalize Communications.<br>
      </strong>Consider personalizing your email and Canvas profile images, so students clearly see when an email is from you.&nbsp; For instructions on personalizing your email profile images:</p>

        </p>

    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>If there is a move to emergency instruction, communication becomes even more important.</strong> Here are some suggestions and guidelines:</p>
    <ul data-rte-list="default">
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Continue the communication habits you have established for the course.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Consider a special communication</strong> (as always posted in multiple places) that clearly reviews any changes to the course because of the change in delivery modality. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Communicate which technologies you will use and how (e.g., Canvas for course work, Teams (or other) for videoconferencing and/or synchronous class meetings, a textbook site for activities, etc.)&nbsp; <strong>Please note:</strong> best practice entails that even if you use a textbook site for activities, all the grades for any activity in the class should still be posted in Canvas, so the student’s total course grade is clear at any moment in the course.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reinforce institutional changes in policies or schedules (e.g. changes in attendance policy, P/F policy, etc.), by sending a message to your students</strong> about how these changes do or do not affect their experience in your class. Forewarn students that changes in schedule and modality could occur based on the trajectory of transmission and community spread. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Communicate resources for students</strong> who may struggle with the transition to remote instruction, including:&nbsp; technology requirements and support services, academic support services, accessibility support services, and mental health services.<em> [I am working to prepare a generic communication for faculty that includes this and any other relevant info that they can tailor as needed]</em></p>
      </li>
