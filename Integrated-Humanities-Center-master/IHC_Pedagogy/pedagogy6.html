    <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Synchronous/Asynchronous Balancing Act</h2>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of the challenges of remote or partially remote instruction is deciding on the appropriate balance between <strong>synchronous</strong> (everyone meeting at the same time and in the same place to cover the same material at roughly the same pace) and<strong> asynchronous</strong> (materials and activities that can be accessed by different members of the class at their convenience) activities.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Many students reported that in Spring 2020, they enjoyed the ability to connect with professors and other students in synchronous environments; they also appreciated the structure and predictability of these meetings, which helped them with motivation.&nbsp; However, many students also sang the praises of asynchronous instruction, which gave them the flexibility they needed to meet personal and workplace demands when learning from home.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Growing evidence suggests that a combination of synchronous and asynchronous activities is best for traditional undergraduate students</strong>. Keep in mind, though, our students are not “online” students—and they don’t want to be!&nbsp; I strongly recommend some synchronous activity (consider some sort of synchronous meetings at least once a week) to help students feel connected to you and to each other.&nbsp; Intentionally created asynchronous activities can complement this personal touch by providing students opportunities to take responsibility for their learning and/or work in project-based teams without the instructor present.</p>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The key issue is again, communication! Particularly with asynchronous learning, faculty ideally will clearly <strong>explain how the asynchronous activities are connected to the work of the course and to the outcomes and learning objectives</strong>.&nbsp; Please do keep in mind:&nbsp; asynchronous activities should not be overly burdensome; they should commensurate with the amount of time they would have spent on the course in a traditional F2F format.</p>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Whether in person or remote, here is a great overview of <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-to-make-your-teaching-more-engaging/" target="_blank"><strong>How To Make Your Teaching More Engaging</strong></a><strong>.</strong> It has practical and helpful tips for activities!</p>

    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Remote Synchronous Strategies &amp; Ideas</h3>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Use synchronous classes to create learning experiences rather than lectures or discussions with you as the “sage on the stage.”</strong>&nbsp; Remember the “one doing is the one learning” and since the average human attention span is about 20 minutes, you students will learn more, the more they are engaged actively in the learning process.&nbsp; You can also stage the following experiences to occur synchronously on Canvas or Teams to break up class-time so it isn’t all lecture:</p>
    <ul data-rte-list="default">
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> A group meeting or discussion (using break out rooms in Canvas or by setting up different channels in Teams).&nbsp; Remind students they have the ability to meet in Teams without you.&nbsp; As members of the team, they can also hold meetings.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp; A “peer review” session on Canvas scheduled and designed to be completed during the class meeting period.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A “collaboration” scheduled and designed to be completed during the class meeting period.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Use interactive tools to drive student engagement—<a href="https://create.kahoot.it/auth/login" target="_blank">Kahoot</a> is a fun and easy quiz tool and <a href="https://www.polleverywhere.com/" target="_blank">Poll Everywhere</a> is an awesome tool that you can use on its own or embedded into PowerPoint or Google slide decks; it gives you access to real-time quizzes, polls, word clouds, and much more.<br>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>When holding a synchronous discussion, be sure to: </strong></p>
    <ul data-rte-list="default">
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have anyone who is not speaking mute their mic to avoid background noise and feedback.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ask students to use webcams, always, but especially if they are talking or presenting.  Try to set the expectation for webcam use BEFORE the first online synchronous class.  If students are reluctant because they don’t want others to see their home or where they student, feel free to share:</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Consider using visuals to break the monotony of the talking head on the screen.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Use polls or other forms of querying students from services like Kahoot and Poll Everywhere to keep students engaged.<br>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Strengthen active engagement/Attendance Concerns<br>
      </strong>When students are using their webcams, you may have <strong>attendance concerns</strong> since some students call in and then seem to walk away or check out in some fashion.</p>
    <ul data-rte-list="default">
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Post along with recorded class lectures or discussions a few questions.&nbsp; Stipulate that to be counted “present,” students must send you answers to the questions (make sure they are at different time points in the class to ensure students listen to the entire recording).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Throw in some questions during the lecture or discussion to which the students must respond—in the chat, by using a tool like Kahoot or Poll Everywhere, or in a communication after the class.&nbsp; You should let students know in advance that if they do not respond to these questions or prompts, they will be counted as “absent” even if their icon was visible during class.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Remind students that we have a shared responsibility for the learning experience. This is not one-sided. “Therefore, you are expected to be present and actively engaged. I will call on you. For my part, I will not lecture beyond 20 minutes.”</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Asynchronous Strategies &amp; Ideas&nbsp; </h3>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong></strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYpJHJPomqg&list=PLdBsCJVVY0jypnfU4VqfCsBGwCOt7xdW9&index=2" target="_blank"><strong>IHC Conversation on Designing Meaningful Asynchronous Activities</strong></a><strong></strong></p>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Asynchronous activities provide an opportunity for students to take responsibility for their learning and/or build relationships with each other by engaging in some activity that produces a deliverable when the class does not meet synchronously.  The most common asynchronous activities are: email, discussion boards, blogs, wikis, podcasts, videos, and e-portfolios.</p>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> Please keep in mind that these “deliverables” should be commensurate to work you would expect students to produce during a class period.&nbsp; A danger when moving to remote instruction is demanding much more work of students than you would in a traditional F2F environment. &nbsp;Make sure you are not giving “busy” work because you are not seeing the students in the same way.&nbsp; Every time you assign something, explain to yourself and to the students how the assignment or the activity helps the students reach one of the course objectives. If you are concerned that you may be giving students too much work, try this <a href="https://cte.rice.edu/workload" target="_blank"><strong>Coursework Calculator</strong></a><strong> </strong>from Rice University.</p>
    <ul data-rte-list="default">
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> <strong>Post a reflection or a quiz along with the recorded lecture (yours or someone else) and/or a film/documentary and/or a podcast</strong> (try to imagine this work taking only the amount of time you would usually ask them to be in class).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Exercise caution with “recorded lectures”</strong> as a default offering as research from the Spring shows that students begin to lose interest in recorded lectures after the first minute!&nbsp; Recorded lectures are great and necessary as a back-up, but use them with caution as a staple of the course.</p>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One pedagogical expert on a webinar I attended suggested using alternatives to lecture delivery when recording information; she suggested using storytelling or case studies as possible alternatives. <strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.nyu.edu/faculty/teaching-and-learning-resources/strategies-for-teaching-with-tech/storytelling-teching-and-learning.html" target="_blank"><strong>How to use Storytelling in teaching</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Have students create a video or presentation</strong> that relates to the work of the class and upload it, then ask the students to comment on each other’s creation by a specified due date.</p>
      </li
				>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> <strong>Have students do a “peer review” or “collaborations” exercise or another group work exercise (this can be synchronous or asynchronous).</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Have students participate in an asynchronous discussion board</strong>—be sure you are “present” regularly to guide discussion and prompt further considerations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Have students keep journal or blogs or even wikis </strong> related to course material—these can be individual or collaborative.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Have students create an e-portfolio</strong> as they progress in the course—demonstrating how they are meeting key course learning objectives.  They create pages in the portfolio were they attach an assignment where they met the objective and explain how they did it—great for reflection!</p>
