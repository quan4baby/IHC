    <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Teach Students How to Learn Online<strong> </strong></h2>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One thing that has come up in many of the webinars I have attended is that we have to help our traditional undergraduate students understand how to learn in hybrid, online, of disrupted F2F courses.&nbsp; In other words, it is not enough to simply move forward with the plan.&nbsp; Our students by and large are not signing up for nor do they prefer online course delivery, but we need to help them be successful in those formats for now.&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> <strong>Explain the way your course is designed and how it works</strong>, if you will be online or hybrid from the beginning.&nbsp; If you are F2F and shift to emergency remote instruction, consider spending much of the first remote class explaining how the course works in this new delivery environment</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Remind them you want them to succeed and that you support their learning.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Organize your syllabus to make clear the learning outcomes and how to succeed (be sure include rubrics). </strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Make time on a regular basis to gauge student learning.&nbsp;</strong> This helps students learn how to reflect, build self-awareness with respect to learning goals, assess their learning and adjust course to meet the goals. These could be 3-2-1 exit tickets or help and hinder surveys. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Take time to review and revisit expectations that are clearly laid out in the syllabus: how much time should they be spending out of class and on what to prepare for class meetings; expectations for class participation, upcoming deadlines and assessments. </strong>Check out this cool <a href="https://cte.rice.edu/workload" target="_blank"><strong>Coursework Calculator</strong></a> from Rice University to figure out how  much work you are giving your students.</p>
